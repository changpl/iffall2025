        <p>
            Although matcha is often traced to Japanese roots, it originated in Tang dynasty China in 762 CE. Both countries have rich historical and cultural ties to the tea; today, it enjoys a vast global presence.

                    The first record of powdered tea in China was in Lu Yu’s “The Classic of Tea” manuscript. At the time, tea leaves were steamed, dried, and pressed into bricks for trade, then ground into powder for consumption.

                    Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang banned powdered tea, causing Chinese matcha culture to gradually fade. Loose leaf tea leaves became the norm; it wouldn’t be until the modern era that matcha regained its popularity.

                <p>
                    In recent decades, matcha has skyrocketed in popularity in part due to aethetics, social media influence, and wellness culture. Once a traditional tea exclusive to East Asian cultures, it can now be found virtually anywhere across the globe in drinks, desserts, and confections. In Japan, institutions like Urasenke and Omotesenke continue to teach and preserve the traditional tea ceremony. In China, powdered tea and matcha have been reintroduced to mainstream culture thanks to global trends. Today, the global matcha industry is estimated to be worth over $3 billion!
